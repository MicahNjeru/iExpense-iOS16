#  iExpense iOS 16
## About The App
- This is an expense app that helps users record their daily expenses
- It has two page views:
1. The main view that displays a list of all expenses by name, type and amount
2. The expense adding page view that lets users add a new expense and save the input


## What I learnt
1. SwiftUI offers a programatic way of navigating between views which saves writing a lot of boiler plate code
2. Passing data between different pages is easier by use of special SwiftUI property wrappers
3. Swift/SwiftUI offers a `UUID()` method that's really helpful in generating unique IDs
